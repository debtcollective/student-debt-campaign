    Tens of million of us are carrying more than $1.5 trillion in student debt.
    Our debt is someone's profit which also makes it a form of leverage over the
    government agencies and the private companies that are extracting from us.
    One million people default every year.
  remark: We must politicize this.
  title: >-
    We demand full cancellation of federal & private student loans. Free public
    college for all!
