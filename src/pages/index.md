          When our son was 3-months old, our tax refund check was stolen from us
          by the government for student loans. We were going to get a crib for
          our son with that tax refund check. Education should be publicly

      We are debtors and supporters who are fighting for FULL student debt
      cancellation as well as free public college. In summer 2019, two bills
      were introduced in Congress that would do just that. For more information
      about those bills, go here:
      https://community.debtcollective.org/t/organizing-to-win-college-for-all/2887
    question: What do Debt Collective members want?
  - answer: >-
      Cancelling all student debt would actually benefit low income borrowers
      the most. Check out this [DEMOS
      report](https://www.demos.org/publication/debt-divide-racial-and-class-bias-behind-new-normal-student-borrowing).
      The truth is there is a deep class bias in how we finance higher
      education. Even though some middle class and wealthier people have lots of
      student debt, lower-income borrowers, especially black and brown people,
      have higher balances and are more likely to leave school because they
      can't afford to pay. Cancelling all student debt would restore our
      commitment to education as a right while disproportionately benefitting
      the people who most need it.


      One reason more and more of us are having a hard time paying down our debt
      is because the cost of college has gone up, but our pay hasn’t. Instead,
      the labor market has "credentialized". This means that, over the last few
      decades, people needed to take on more debt to get more degrees just to
      get the same jobs earning the same wages as people in previous
      generations. [As one analysis
      shows](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PDFLooneyTextFallBPEA.pdf),
      a result of this credentialization is that more and more people have
      defaulted on their loans and more defaulters are low-income people and
      racial minorities, the same people who sought college credentials to try
      to get a pay raise that never materialized. If college led to a higher
      paying job, then cancelling the debts of college graduates would be
      regressive. But since most people, especially working class people, take
      on debt for degrees that DON’T lead to better jobs, cancelling student
      debt is NOT regressive. Want to learn more? [We refer you to economist
      Marshall Steinbaum on this
      question](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/06/is-student-debt-cancellation-regressive-no).
    question: >-
      What do you say to the charge that cancelling all student loans would be a
      big giveaway to the upper middle class, in other words that it would be
      "regressive"?
  - answer: >-
      When a policy is intended to help some people and not others, it is harder
      to pass (because the people who don’t benefit are less likely to support
      it). In addition, targeted (or what some call “means-tested”) relief would
      not treat education as a right. As we explained above, if education is a
      right then everyone should have access to it. For decades, college was
      free or low cost. Making people take out loans shifted the burden of
      paying for college onto the backs of students and families. If the
      policies that led us to this crisis were bad, then we should correct them
      once and for all. It’s true that full student debt cancellation will
      benefit some relatively well-off borrowers. That’s fine by us because most
      of the people who benefit will be regular working-class people who are
      struggling to get by and, again, education is a right.
    question: Why not just target relief to those carrying the biggest burden?
  - answer: >-
      A student debt jubilee must go hand in hand with making public college
      tuition free. Future generations should not be burdened with student debt.
      It is time to end it.
    question: >-
      What about the cost of college going forward? If we cancel all debt now,
      what about future borrowers who would be left out?
  - answer: >-
      The rise in college debt has nothing to do with borrowers being
      “irresponsible.” This is not a matter of individual behavior but of public
      policy. No one should have ever had to go into debt for education. It is
      awful and historically tragic that people were forced to take out loans to
      study and for the right to prepare for a career. Our government should
      stop harming people for simply wanting to go to college. We must return
      education to the status of a public good.
    question: >-
      Students who took out loans knew what they were getting into. Why should
      they be let out of their responsibilities?
  - answer: >-
      It is unfair for anyone to have been forced into debt for a basic right
      like education. This is not a good reason to keep inflicting injustice on
      future generations. There was a time when the US did not provide free
      public high school, and at the time that free high school came into
      existence there were those who had just turned 18 and missed out. The fact
      that anyone over 18 had already missed out would not have been a good
      reason to refuse to provide public K-12 education to everyone else. It is
      irrational to continue with a bad policy simply because people have
      already suffered under it. It is time to make college free, cancel student
      debt, and liberate people to pursue their dreams.
    question: >-
      What do we do about the people who have already paid back all of their
      student loans? Won’t mass debt relief be unfair to them?
  - answer: >-
      We are sorry you feel that way. You too should have your debts wiped out.
      Education is a human right and should be free.
    question: >-
      What do you say to people who say things like, "Well, I am fortunate to
      pay back my student loans. But I do it and so should everyone else."
  - answer: >-
      This is a common talking point coming from some elected officials and
      politicians who want to continue with our current debt-financed education
      system. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, for example, says she opposes
      College for All for this reason. The truth is that cancelling student debt
      and freeing people to study without fear of debt would actually be good
      for us all. If more funds are needed to pay for universal access to
      college, we have a simple solution: TAX THE RICH. If poor, working and
      middle class people are paying for others to attend school, then our
      elected officials are failing us. Politicians should get the money from
      Jeff Bezos. They should go after Wall Street banks. They could go after
      the endowment funds being hoarded by rich, private universities. There is
      plenty of money to pay for what we want; it’s just in the wrong hands. Our
      answer to this question is: Stop fleecing working people while denying us
      our public goods. In fact, maybe the reason billionaire Betsy DeVos and
      company actually oppose College for All is because they don’t want their
      taxes to go up.
    question: >-
      Wouldn’t cancelling student debt require people who didn’t go to college
      to pay the tuition bills of people who did?
  - answer: >-
      Academic research shows that eliminating student debt for everyone would
      provide a significant boost to the economy. Specifically, a debt jubilee
      would  boost the economy by approximately $100 billion a year for at least
      10 years, yielding lower unemployment rates, increased spending, and more.
      The study also shows that full cancellation would have only a moderate
      effect on the federal budget deficit. [Read the full report
      here](http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/the-macroeconomic-effects-of-student-debt-cancellation).
    question: "What impact will cancelling student debt have on the economy? "
  - answer: >-
      The good news is that it doesn’t cost very much to get rid of all student
      debt. [A study by
      economists](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/rpr_2_6.pdf) estimated that
      eliminating all $1.5 trillion in student debt would grow the economy by
      $86 billion to $108 billion every year and create over a million jobs a
      year. In total the deficit-to-GDP ratio would likely increase by
      significantly less than 1%. We find it curious, though, that the “how will
      you pay for it” question is never asked when politicians want to do things
      like send American troops into other countries or raise taxes on the rich.
      In 2018, for example, Congress passed a huge tax cut for millionaires and
      billionaires, one of the largest in history. Did anyone bother to explain
      how it would be paid for? The truth is that Congress has the ability to
      authorize spending when it regards that expenditure as important for the
      public. It’s time that they used that power for millions of people
      drowning in student debt.
    question: "OK, but how do we pay for it?"
  - answer: >
      No. As Astra Taylor
      [described](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/24/elizabeth-warren-student-debt-cancel-grassroots)
      in the Guardian and as [Luke Herrine
      wrote](https://www.theregreview.org/2017/01/06/herrine-future-educations-power-to-cancel-debt/)
      in a law journal, Congress has already given administrative agencies the
      power to cancel debts. This power is called “Compromise and Settlement”
      authority. Just as the Securities and Exchange Commission can cut
      low-dollar deals with banks that break the law, for example, the Secretary
      of Education

      can settle with debtors for a fraction of what they owe or suspend the
      collection of

      student debt altogether. When it was first given the power to issue and
      collect student loans in 1958, the US Department of Education also
      received the power to “compromise, waive, or release any right” to collect
      on them. And when the Higher Education Act of 1965 made student

      loan authorities permanent, it solidified their power to compromise. We
      believe it is time

      that the Department use its authority to stop collections on student
      loans. Nothing in the

      law prevents the Secretary from doing so. Congressional authority is not
      needed. A President who wanted to see student debt cancelled could simply
      direct his or her Department of Education to cancel the debt.
    question: Does Congress Have to Approve Debt Relief?
  - answer: >-
      Education should be free but it should also give us more liberty. Most of
      the time, we are told that education is key to finding employment and the
      only path out of poverty. In reality, our country’s economic problems
      can’t be solved by education alone—producing more college graduates won’t
      make more meaningful well-paying jobs magically appear! Nevertheless, that
      is the message that we hear all the time. The implication is that
      education is nothing but career training, and that if we don’t go to
      college, we don’t deserve to make a living wage or work in a field we
      enjoy. We oppose this kind of thinking as much as we oppose student debt.
      The desire to study and learn is part of what makes us human. Cancelling
      student debt and making college free would not end inequality or solve
      other social problems. Free education means the freedom to decide what to
      do with our lives. We want to learn in ways that we choose. We don’t want
      to be “human capital.” We want schools organized in our interest, not in
      the interest of lenders or employers. We know that college can be free and
      freeing. And we are ready to fight for it.
